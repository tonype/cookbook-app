# Cookbook
An MEAN stack app for my spouse and I to keep track of and search for recipes we like.

## To do
- Add models for Recipes, Ingredients, Units, and Tags
- Dockerize everything

## Refactors to consider
- UI: Consider DRYing out Ingredients/Units/Tags CRUD and List. Keeping them separate for now.
